This post is a reflection following up a recent article.

In my experience in Earth science, research software development is always under-appreciated. Software development never has received enough credit and needless to say publish a high impact journal.

Looking back in 2015-2017 when I started to use Github, there was barriers that precents me from practicing the open source better. I had several papers that I didn't share all the code and data then.

But now I have contributed multiple open source projects. With platforms like Github, Zenoto, Overleaf, sharing resources are becoming easier and easier.

But at the same time, I can still see lots of papers are not making the data and code publicly available, especially when the conclusion drawn is also questionable.

My current practice to promote open source:

1. Only read and recommend papers that share both data and code;
2. Only cite papers that share both data and code;

Like the old saying, talk is cheap, show me the code, we cannot trust research that cannot be reproduced.
